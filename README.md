# TriviaGame

What the project does:
    Archer Trivia is an online trivia game that asks questions based off the American adult animated sitcom 'Archer.' There are ten questions, and the user has a limited amount of time to answer all of the questions. Correct answers, incorrect answers, and "no guesses" are all tallied and displayed after the user clicks on the submit button at the botton of the page or time runs out.

Why the project is useful
    The project is intended to showcase the usefulness and application of on-click events, and how to use them with functions,
    "grabbing" values from an element, and utilizing the setInterval() and setTimeout() methods.

How users can get started with the project
    Begin answering the timed questions by clicking on the 'start' button on the first page.
